## nMigen Basys3 Platform File

This is a currently in progress platform file used to synthesize and upload nMigen implementations onto a Digilent Basys3.

This requires the Vivado toolchain and Digilent USB-JTAG drivers. Installations vary widely across platforms, so ymmv. Currently this board file works on Arch Linux, no promises on performance with any other OS.

Also, I feel weird pointing this out but: **I am not responsible for damage to your Basys3/other hardware!!** Working with any sort of hardware runs the risk of damage, so use this at your own risk. I'll probably just pull this repo if I nuke my Basys3.
